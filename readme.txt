A Group-like block that aligns/wraps .value relative to .label. Adjustable label width, gap and padding.

== Description ==
Use this for rows like "Experiences" / "Destinations", Fast Facts, etc. Place your label (and optional icon) inside the "label" child, and your terms/post-connection inside the "value" child. In "Wrap under" mode, long values drop beneath the label. In "Align" mode, values stay alongside via CSS Grid.

== Changelog ==
0.1.0 Initial.
